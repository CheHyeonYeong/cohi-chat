## Core Principles

**Design Strategy**: Begin by understanding context—purpose, audience, tone, and technical constraints—then commit to a bold aesthetic direction that feels intentional rather than random.

## Key Guidelines

- Select distinctive typography; avoid common defaults like Arial or Inter
- Develop cohesive color schemes with dominant hues and sharp accents
- Implement thoughtful animations and micro-interactions
- Use unexpected spatial composition with asymmetry and negative space
- Add atmospheric details through textures, gradients, or custom effects

## What to Avoid

- Generic aesthetics including predictable font families
- Clichéd gradient schemes
- Cookie-cutter layouts
- Overused design patterns that lack contextual character

## Implementation Philosophy

Match code complexity to your aesthetic vision:
- Elaborate designs warrant extensive animations
- Refined minimalism requires precision in spacing and typography

**Remember**: Truly memorable interfaces result from committed creative choices specific to their purpose, rather than convergence on safe, conventional solutions.
